Hello and welcome to my blog! This is my first post on this website. I am taking this opportunity to write what's next. I plan to blog about interesting questions, things I'm struggling through (particularly in business), and other concepts I've found worth sharing. Posts will be irregularly but at minimum monthly.

I will also be including direct links to previous projects in the [projects](/projects/) tab. There, you'll learn more about what I'm up to and what I'm most interested in at the moment. 

As of writing this post, I currently work a full-time job in Bixby, OK -- saving money for my ultimate return to college for my BS in Economics from Oklahoma State University. I will be pursuing education full-time in August 2025.
